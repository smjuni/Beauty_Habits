Clinique Happy™ Perfume Spray delights with a hint of citrus- a wealth of flowers- a mix of emotions. Continue the happy experience with rich- hydrating Body Cream and on-the-go purse spray. This set contains:- 1.7 oz/ 50 mL Clinique Happy™ Perfume Spray- 0.34 oz/ 10 mL Clinique Happy™ Perfume Spray- 2.5 oz/ 75 mL Clinique Happy™ Body Cream,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Clinique Happy™ Perfume Spray: Alcohol Denat. - Clinique Happy Perfume (Parfum) - Water\Aqua\Eau - Butylphenyl Methylpropional - Benzyl Alcohol - Hydroxycitronellal - Limonene - Citronellol - Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone - Linalool - Citral - Geraniol.

The two come in a reusable acrylic case ideal for traveling with your perfumes or for toting pens.In Myth- the airy beauty of jasmine petals and tiger orchid meet the sexy- undeniable warmth of liquid musks and white cedarwood. It's a sophisticated fragrance for the senses- worthy of the myths it will create. Rrose is a fresh rose fragrance—an olfactive ode to Rrose Sélavy (a pun on ""Eros- C’est la Vie"")- the feminine alter ego of the author- artist- and provocateur Marcel Duchamp—and is as playful as its muse. Petals of Centifolia roses sparkle with peony and Sicilian lemon above a seductive base of spring musks and cashmere woods.This set contains:- 2 x 0.33 oz/ 10 mL Eau de Parfums in Myth and Rrose- Travel caseClean at Sephora
Clean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients- including sulfates (SLS and SLES)- parabens- phthalates- and more. For the full list- check out the Ingredients tab.",Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent.

Fragrance Description: JVxNJ Silver captures that moment of irresistible momentum as day begins. When you let go- take a deep breath and look ahead to the next great thing. The scent is supercharged with a vivifying freshness that pulsates throughout the fragrance.
","Suggested Usage:
-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. 
-After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. 
-If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. 
-Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.

Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil.

At the heart- velvety jasmine warms to a dreamy drydown of sensual sandalwood for a romantic- lingering finish. Sophisticated but not too serious- Daisy Eau So Fresh sparkles with a sunny- vibrant energy. A spirited incarnation of the original Daisy- this fragrance excites the senses with a bright elegance and whimsical charm. Like the woman who wears it- Daisy Eau So Fresh inspires boldness and femininity- sweetness and unpredictability. The scent's enticing top notes of raspberry and grapefruit sparkle on the skin like sunshine- deepening into a sensuous heart of wild rose and a musky- sophisticated finish of warm plum and cedarwood. Addictive and irresistible- Daisy Love fills the air with a contagious love of life. Created by master perfumer Alberto Morillas- this gourmand radiant fragrance reveals its first notes in a vibrant burst of sweet cloudberries. Delicate daisy tree petals mingle with sparkling cashmere musks and driftwood to create a lasting and memorable gourmand twist.This set contains:- 3 x 0.33 oz/ 10 mL Eau de Toilette pen sprays in Daisy- Daisy Eau So Fresh- and Daisy LoveAbout the Fragrance: Charmingly simple with a signature quality- Marc Jacobs Daisy transports you to a place that optimistic- beautiful- and pure.  ,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil.

It speaks to a unique- dynamic- enthusiastic- and passionate person.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,Alchohol Denat.

Bright- bitter orange and vivid iris aldehyde inject vibrant color into a heart of patchouli- musk- and tonka bean. A seductive overture of rich cocoa absolute ensures irresistible depth.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil.

One of Versace's most beloved jewel-fragrances in the world.Bright Crystal Absolu is the intense version where the essence of Bright Crystal is enhanced to the extreme. Absolu is a floral and fruity fragrance with a musk note.This set contains:- 0.17 oz/ 5 mL Bright Crystal Miniature Deluxe- 0.17 oz/ 5 mL Bright Crystal Absolu Miniature Deluxe,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent. -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin.

This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil.
